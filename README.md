# Loan-Approval

Loan approval is a critical task in the banking sector, where institutions need to
determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. Traditional manual approval
processes are time-consuming and may be subject to bias or inconsistency. This
project leverages machine learning algorithms to automate and improve the loan
approval process using a dataset containing applicant information. By training
and evaluating multiple models, the best-performing one is selected and deployed
for real-time predictions. The system predicts whether a loan will be approved or
rejected based on applicant data, potentially assisting financial institutions in faster
and more consistent decision-making.
